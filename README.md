# CODE ENGINE

Code Engine is an application software developed using python.
Main function is to generate random code with the encrypt option.
Generated code can be exported as binary file after encryption.
Private key can be copied after encryption.

IF intend to use with ENGINE SERIALIZER
Binary file can be decrypted together with the matching key.

Key string will be converted to list of integer then will be stored
as "PEM" file when serialize is executed (ref. to code-decrypt repo).
